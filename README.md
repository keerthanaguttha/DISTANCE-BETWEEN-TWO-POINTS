import math
list1 = [4,2]
list2 = [10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((list2[0]-list1[0])**2) + ((list2[1] - list1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```



### OUTPUT:
![Distance](https://github.com/keerthanaguttha/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/145742927/47cbbb33-0e7e-4925-9e00-b89dfaa0e0fc)



### RESULT:
Thus the distance between two points is executed sucessfully.
